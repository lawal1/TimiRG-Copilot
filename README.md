Rapha AI is an advanced open-source medical application designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of obstetric ultrasound scans, particularly in developing regions where medical resources can be limited. Using Gemini AI, Rapha AI significantly accelerates the process of analyzing ultrasound data, allowing radiologists to document and interpret scan sessions up to 5 times faster. By automatically extracting essential data and creating structured medical reports, Rapha AI empowers healthcare providers to focus on patient care, reducing the time spent on manual documentation.

## Features

- **Voice-Activated Analysis**: Rapha AI takes in voice recordings from the scan sessions and identifies key elements of the ultrasound, such as:
  - Gestational age
  - Fetal size and position
  - Number of fetuses
  - Placenta location
  - Amniotic fluid levels
  - Fetal movement and heart rate
  - Umbilical cord condition
  - Any detected abnormalities

- **Automated Report Generation**: Extracted data is automatically compiled into a detailed report that can be reviewed, edited, and printed immediately, saving time for radiologists and enhancing report accuracy.

- **Optimized Workflow**: With AI-powered data extraction and documentation, Rapha AI aims to streamline the ultrasound process, making it easier to handle high patient volumes without compromising diagnostic quality.
